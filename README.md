# Brain-statement-decoding
## Dataset: HCP nifti data
## Preprosess: mmp
## Model: MLP
Training a MLP by HCP dataset with 8 task contrasts(Language,Motion,Loss,Reward,Relation,Emotion,Memory,Social), apply the model to lab collected data, obtain the participants brain activity when they are viewing the specific video./
The average probabilities of each task across timeline./
The final result./
